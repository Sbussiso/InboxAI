# Current problems/limitations
- Gmail only
  
  you must have a gmail account to use this application, inboxAI will only accept an gmail address (for now, more email support will be added later)

- Loading screens

  there are no elaborate loading screens at this time so wait a few after you click a button to be sure it isnt already loading. This will be resolved in a future update.

- 3rd party API

  the openAI GPT-3 api is a 3rd party service not created by me so the security of your data also relies on openAI. You are using this service at your own risk.

- assistant text box

  currently you may experience issues with not being able to scroll correctly when interacting with the AI assistant. This is something that will be resolved in a future update

- summarization problems

  emails can be structured very differently and inboxAI cannot read every one. That being said as time goes on it will be better and better being able to understand more and more email structures.

- initial start display

  when you first log in the first email display will be empty, Just press next and then back to view it and all others. This will be resolved in a future update.
